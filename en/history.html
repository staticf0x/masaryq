        <p>Todays MasaryQ came to be as a union of two clubs: the older QMU and the newer MasaryQ.</p>

        <p>QMU (Queer platform MU, aka "kvemu") was established in 2012 as a club not just for LGBT+ folks. The goal of QMU was primarily to create a space for meeting and getting acquainted and to inform about queer topics. Within QMU there were regular meetings in teahouses and cafes, and the club often presented itself at various events by Masaryk university and even elsewhere. Due to the time unavailability of the organizers the activities of QMU were reduced just to meetings in teahouses, which the COVID pandemy stopped completely.</p>

        <p>After the discussions on IS MUNI about the possibility of having preferred pronouns in the system, there were multiple negative reactions and transphobic comments, and a few people from the Faculty of Informatics decided to create a Discord server called MUNI LGBT+. It served as a safe space from all the discrimination and bullying that LGBT+ folks were often the target of by other students and even teachers. Over time it got new members even outside the faculty, until finally there was a meeting with QMU and we created the current university club MasaryQ.</p>
