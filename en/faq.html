        <h3>How did this club start?</h3>
        <p>MUNI LGBT+ came to be as a club for queer folks whose goal is to survive more than one generation of students. After learning how queer students are bullied and discriminated here, we didn't have a choice but to organize and fight it collectively.</p>

        <h3>What do we expect from members?</h3>

        <p>We expect that they help organize at least one club event during the year and attend club meetings.</p>

        <h3>Why become a member?</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Become a part of a community of inspirative people.</li>
        <li>Every change we achieve will be also thanks to you.</li>
        <li>Space for realizing your own ideas.</li>
        <li>You will get many nontraditional and informative experiences.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Can I join, even if I don't study at MUNI?</h3>
        <p>Of course, there is no problem with that.</p>
