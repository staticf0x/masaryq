        <h3>What is MasaryQ?</h3>

        <p>It's a (mostly) Masaryk University students' club focused on the needs of the LGBT+ community. MasaryQ replaced the the former QMU club.</p>

        <h3>What activities are we planning?</h3>

        <p>Initially mainly presentations on LGBT+ topics, because education is important. We also want to mediate communication between the students and the university and help those LGBT+ students who otherwise have no one to turn to. And last but not least, we plan on having regular friendly meetings in teahouses, where it will be possible to get to know others better.</p>

        <h3>How to join us?</h3>

        <p>You can participate in discussions on our Facebook, or if you are interested, you can also participate in the organization of the club and be added here on the website in the list of members.</p>

        <h3>Can I join even if I'm not an LGBT+ person or a student of MUNI?</h3>

        <p>Of course! Everyone is welcome here, the only conditions are decency and not insulting others.</p>

        <h3>What are the obligations or responsibilities of our members?</h3>

        <p>There are no specific obligations, membership is voluntary and it's up to you how much time you are willing to spend organizing the club. However, you are expected to help if asked by the club's management.</p>
